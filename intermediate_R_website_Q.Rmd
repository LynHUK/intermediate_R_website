```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
library(webexercises)
```

## Test your understanding

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
# Uncomment to change widget colours:
#style_widgets(incorrect = "goldenrod", correct = "purple")
```

What is the total attendance across the 5 rows with the lowest attendances? `r fitb(15)`

`r hide("See a hint")`

Use **?slice** to look at the help file to find the function you need to get a small dataframe of the 5 rows with the lowest attendance. You can then use **sum()** to get the total of the attendances column.

<!-- `r unhide()` -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, webex.hide = "Click here to see an explanation"} -->
<!-- q1_df<- slice_min(data, n=5, order_by = breaches) -->

<!-- sum(q1_df$attendances) # This will give the answer = 15 -->
<!-- ``` -->
